~~~ What is this? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~


This zip file contains prompt icons for Xbox, Playstation, and Switch controllers.  They're created by Jeremy Statz, at Kittehface Software ( http://kittehface.com ). We help people bring their games to console among other game dev stuff, if you need a hand with something like that please get in touch!  Based on our experience these should be fully certification compliant and I don't expect you'll have any issues submitting to the console manufacturers when using them.

If you have any problems, shoot me an e-mail at jstatz@kittehface.com or find me on Twitter as @Jeremy_Statz.

These were originally created in Affinity Designer, and I've included that original source file in addition to an SVG and EPS export, a 2048 wide PNG export, and a Gimp xcf file that's mostly the same as the PNG but with guides in place.  The font on the prompts is Consolas in bold.  The icons are arranged neatly in a grid within the file, should you prefer to use it rather than the saved-out individual files in the platform sub-folders.  In the 2048 wide export, each icon uses 128x128 of the space.

The exported individual prompts are arranged in folders by platform.  They are 128x128 and all use the same naming convention based (mostly) on the Xbox pad.  Controller buttons are named based on their physical location on that gamepad.

Keyboard prompts are named after their respective keys, with a few display decisions made to help keep numpad/main body keys unique.  The kb_comma.png file for example, actually displays the < symbol.  There are also some extras present depending on whether you're treating left/right control/alt/shift as distinct or not.  This folder also contains prompts for common mouse buttons & functions.

The controller prompts are free to use however you wish, including in commercial works, and you can modify them as you see fit.  If you can give credit that would be cool (and I'd love to know you're using them), but it's not required.
